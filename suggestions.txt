Based on the logs, here are suggestions to fix common failures:

1. [CRITICAL] Enable Implicit Variable Extraction
   - **Issue:** Commands like `press tab` or `type hello` fail because the Local LLM is only asked to return `{"id": <number>}`. The `data.get("var")` check fails, so `variable` is empty.
   - **Fix:** Update `CognitivePlanner.plan` system prompt to ask for `{"id": <number>, "var": "optional_extracted_content"}`.
   - **Benefit:** Allows natural commands like `press enter` without needing `|`.

2. [Improvement] Handle Pipe Separator Typos
   - **Issue:** `type I john@company.com` failed because `I` was read instead of `|`.
   - **Fix:** In `CognitivePlanner.plan`, if `|` is missing but `type` or `open` is present, treat the first space or `I` as a separator if no other matching pattern exists. A regex like `r"(type|open)\s+[I|l]\s+(.*)"` could help.

3. [Robustness] Add 'mewact' Alias
   - **Issue:** `mewact` (no space) sometimes fails or relies on keyword generation.
   - **Fix:** Add `"mewact": {"id": 107, ...}` as an alias in `command_library.json`.
   - **Benefit:** Instant recognition without LLM overhead.

4. [Feedback] Missing Variable Warning
   - **Issue:** `$V1` not found warning is printed but Cloud AI might miss it if `mew act` happens later.
   - **Fix:** Consider pasting error messages into the clipboard or showing an on-screen notification so `mew act` captures the failure.

5. [User Education] Multi-Step Commands
   - **Issue:** `type url and press enter` was treated as one command (`type text`).
   - **Fix:** Ensure documentation emphasizes splitting commands:
     - `&&$47 1 type | url $$&47`
     - `&&$47 2 press enter $$&47`

6. [user] add robusntess in maintaining the current window or tab in documentation so there are no unexpected cutoffs between the chatbot and mewact when switching tab
